# Soft-Computing---FCM-Fuzzy-c-means-Clustering-
## Fuzzy C-means Clustering using C:
- Fuzzy c-means (FCM) is a data clustering technique in which a dataset is grouped into n clusters with every datapoint in the dataset belonging to every cluster to a certain degree.
- For example, a certain datapoint that lies close to the centre of a cluster will have a high degree of belonging or membership to that cluster and another datapoint that lies far away from the centre of a cluster will have a low degree of belonging or membership to that cluster.
